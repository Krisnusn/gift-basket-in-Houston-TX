gift-basket-in-Houston-TX
=========================

I ordered a gift basket delivered to his grandmother in Houston for her birthday (to be ordered from abroad). Order issued the day before the birth of online  http://www.houston-giftbaskets.com and gift arrives on time. Asked to replace some items in the cart and everything was done at its best. I telephoned the company, I have answered all questions, and later by mail answered all of my additional questions. Thanks for the creative approach, all things fruits are very tasty, fresh, and most importantly from the heart are made! Thank you very much!
